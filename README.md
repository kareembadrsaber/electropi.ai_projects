##In the DataPrepKit capstone project
students will create a Python package that serves as a comprehensive toolkit for preprocessing datasets. Leveraging their knowledge of NumPy and Pandas, students will design functions to seamlessly read data from various file formats, provide a data summary, handle missing values, and encode categorical data. The final deliverable will be a published package on PyPI under the name "DataPrepKit."
Key Features:

1. Data Reading: Implement functions to read data from different file formats such as CSV, Excel, and JSON, using Pandas.
2. Data Summary: Develop functions that print key statistical summaries of the data, including the average and most frequent values, utilizing NumPy and Pandas.
3. Handling Missing Values: Create functions to handle missing values by either removing or imputing them based on predefined strategies.
4. Categorical Data Encoding: Implement encoding functions for categorical variables, enabling users to convert them into numerical representations.
5. Package Deployment: Publish the DataPrepKit package on PyPI to make it easily accessible to the broader Python community.

Project Requirements:
1. Efficient utilization of NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
2. Implementation of robust functions for data reading, summary generation, missing value handling, and categorical data encoding.
3. Successful registration and deployment of the package on PyPI.

##Evaluation Criteria:
* Functionality and correctness of the implemented data preprocessing features.
* Quality and completeness of the documentation.
* Effectiveness of the test suite in ensuring the reliability of the package.
* Successful deployment of the package on PyPI.
* Adherence to best practices in coding, packaging, and testing
* Creativity and efficiency in addressing different file formats and data preprocessing challenges.
